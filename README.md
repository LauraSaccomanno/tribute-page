## Motivation
The purpose of this project was to put into practice the knowledge acquired during the training course and to make my project available to anyone who wants to see how he made it. The result of this challenge is the creation of a tribute page, in my case about the Beatles, which shows relevant content regarding the subject. The challenge suggested adopting your own personal style, therefore I approached the realization of the project by first paying particular attention to the organization of the layouts and the choice of the color palette.

## User Stories
List of user stories to do to overcome the project:

- **User Story #1**: The tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

- **User Story #2**: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string that describes the subject of the tribute page.

- **User Story #3**: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

- **User Story #4**: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

- **User Story #5**: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

- **User Story #6**: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

- **User Story #7**: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

- **User Story #8**: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

- **User Story #9**: The img element should be centered within its parent element.
